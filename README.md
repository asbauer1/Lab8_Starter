2)  Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no) No, that'd be more of a unit test thing. 
3)  Yes, it would be appropriate for checking the interaction is behaving as expected. 
4)  Yes, its still appropriate as its testing an isolated area of behavior.
